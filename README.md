# My Advent of Code solutions

This repository is a collection of solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). At the moment I am trying to solve all puzzles from 2021 in Python and Java. In the future I want to extend it with more languages like Go, Kotlin or Ruby and also for previous years.



### What is contained in the repo?

The directory for each of the puzzles contains the following files:

    -    `input.txt` contains the puzzle input.

    -    the content of `part1.*` and `part2.*` are the solutions of the two parts of each day. On some days there might only be one file containing both parts.
